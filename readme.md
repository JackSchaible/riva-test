## Setup Instructions

Choose one of the following setup methods:

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for Backend)

The fastest way to get the backend running with a database:

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
git clone <repository-url>
cd riva-test

# Start backend + SQL Server with Docker Compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd client
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

- **Backend API**: Available at `http://localhost:80`
- **Frontend**: Available at `http://localhost:5173`
- **SQL Server**: Runs in container with automatic schema setup

### Option 2: Manual Development Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd riva-test
```

#### 2. Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

Start with the client setup since the backend needs to know the client URL for CORS configuration.

Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

Update the API URL in `src/config.ts` if needed:

```typescript
export const config = {
  apiUrl: "https://localhost:7154/api/contact",
};
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. **Note the port number** - you'll need it for the backend CORS configuration.

#### 3. Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core)

Navigate to the server directory and restore dependencies:

```bash
cd server
dotnet restore
```

Configure the application settings. Copy this configuration to `ContactManager/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:5174"],
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ContactManager;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"
  }
}
```

**Important**: Make sure the `AllowedOrigins` includes your frontend URL. The default configuration includes `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:5174` (common Vite dev server ports). If your frontend runs on a different port, update this array accordingly.

Create the database by running the setup script:

```bash
# Using SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or your favourite SQL editor: Open and execute server/setup.sql
# OR using sqlcmd:
sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\mssqllocaldb" -i setup.sql
```

Run the application:

```bash
cd ContactManager
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:7154` (or the port shown in the console).

#### 4. Database Setup

The application uses Dapper with SQL Server. Run the provided SQL setup script to create the database and tables:

##### Option 1: Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
3. Open the file `server/setup.sql`
4. Execute the script

##### Option 2: Using sqlcmd command line

```bash
cd server
sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\mssqllocaldb" -i setup.sql
```

##### Option 3: Using Azure Data Studio, SSMS, or similar tools

1. Open your preferred SQL client
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
3. Open and execute `server/setup.sql`

The script will:

- Create the `ContactManager` database if it doesn't exist
- Create the `Contacts` table with proper schema
- Add performance indexes for searching
- Insert sample data (optional - you can remove this section from the script)

## Usage

### Adding Contacts

1. Click the "Add Contact" button
2. Fill in the required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone)
3. Click "Save" to create the contact

### Searching Contacts

The search functionality includes the following features:

- **Minimum Characters**: Search requires at least 3 characters
- **Debounced Input**: Search executes 500ms after you stop typing
- **Multi-term Search**: The search breaks your query on spaces and searches each term against:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email Address
- **Real-time Results**: Results update as you type (after the 3-character minimum)

**Example**: Searching for "john doe" will find contacts where:

- First name contains "john" AND last name contains "doe", OR
- First name contains "doe" AND last name contains "john", OR
- Email contains both "john" and "doe" in any order

### Contact Actions

- **Edit**: Click the pencil icon to modify contact details
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a contact (with confirmation)
- **Email**: Click any email address to open your default email client
- **Phone**: Click any phone number to initiate a call (on mobile devices)

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd server
dotnet test  # Runs unit tests

# Run integration tests (requires Docker)
dotnet test ContactManager.IntegrationTests
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd client
pnpm test
# or
npm test
```
